<p>Hi. I'm Andrew. I like to make things and have crazy ideas. I'm basically Carl Sagan's long-lost evil computer scientist cousin. We share a hungry curiosity, a philosophical slant and a splash of big universe dreams. This is good because the universe is awesome. This is bad because the awesome parts are really close to the sketchy parts where before you know it you're shooting a flaming arrow into a balloon of hydrogen gas just to see what happens, or downloading the full version of WinRAR, also just to see what happens. I go to Cornell in upstate New York, which is good because there is a lot of nature to sit in and the sky is big enough to contain big ideas.</p>
<p>I'm starting this new blog format where I'll post my projects, past and present. Here's a preview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Birds: simulation of flocking behavior.</li>
<li>The Land of Stuff: online fantasy adventure game.</li>
<li>Sound Transfer: transfer data between computers with microphone and speaker.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site is made using my own static site generator, <a href="https://github.com/qema/nanosite">nanosite</a>. It's a bare-bones boilerplate smasher and is customizable to the core.</p>
<p>Expect more soon.</p>
