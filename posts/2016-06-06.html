  <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
  <p><img alt="Beebe Lake" src="http://wanganzhou.com/images/photos/beebe.jpg" /></p>
<p>Hi. I'm Andrew. I like to make things and have crazy ideas. I'm basically Carl Sagan's long-lost evil computer scientist cousin. We share a hungry curiosity, a philosophical slant and a splash of big universe dreams. This is good because the universe is awesome. This is bad because the awesome parts are really close to the sketchy parts that involve shooting a flaming arrow into a balloon of hydrogen gas just to see what happens, or downloading the full version of WinRAR, also just to see what happens. I go to Cornell in upstate New York, which is good because there is a lot of nature to sit in and the sky is big enough to contain big ideas.</p>
<p>I'm starting this new blog format where I'll post my projects, past and present. Here's a preview:</p>
<ul>
<li>Birds: simulation of flocking behavior.</li>
<li>The Land of Stuff: online fantasy adventure game.</li>
<li>Sound Transfer: transfer data between computers with microphone and speaker.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site is made using my own static site generator, <a href="https://github.com/qema/nanosite">nanosite</a>. It's a bare-bones boilerplate smasher and is customizable to the core.</p>
<p>Expect more soon.</p>
